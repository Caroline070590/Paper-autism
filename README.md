## Overview
This repository contains the code used in our study exploring the classification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on functional brain networks using machine learning.

## Input Data
The input data consists of functional connectivity matrices derived from resting-state fMRI BOLD signals. These matrices are used to compute complex network features and train machine learning models.

### üìÅ Where can I find the matrices?
The input matrices can be accessed through the **Supplementary Material** of the published article:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Only anonymized or pre-processed matrices are included due to data privacy restrictions.

## Repository Structure
- `Calculate-all-measures.ipynb`: Computes complex network measures from the connectivity matrices.
- `Machine-Learning-parallelized.ipynb`: Performs classification of ASD using various machine learning algorithms.
- `measures.py`: Contains helper functions used across the notebooks to extract network metrics.
